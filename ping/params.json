Just point your phone, tap its color, and, if its pîngable, you should get information about it. You can also pîng other nearby people if they have the app.\r\n\r\n### What to test\r\nBasically I need to know if it works, obviously, in different cases and situations. There is only so much testing I can do by myself, so I just want you to try it out. \r\n\r\n### Feedback and Suggestions\r\nPlease [email me](mailto:kochrt@miamioh.edu) if you find bugs or have suggestions for improvement. If you don't tell me I won't know about it. \r\n",
