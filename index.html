          <a id="what-is-pîng" class="anchor" href="#what-is-p%C3%AEng" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is pîng?</h3>

          <p>Ping is a location based information and social app that allows you to get information about things, and potentially people, around you. Right now these things are limited to businesses and people. The idea is that you should be able to <b>point your phone and find out about the business or person you’re pointing at</b>, so long as they have set themselves to be pingable, and they are <b>within visual range</b>.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <a id="ok" class="anchor" href="#ok" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ok.</h3>

            <p>The problem is that there are too many different things close together. How can we delimit the different things we’re pointing at? There are a number of ways, one of which is <font size="5"><font color="red">c</font><font color="orange">o</font><font color="green">l</font><font color="blue">o</font><font color="purple">r</font></font>      <font size="1"><sup>wow</sup></font> </p>

            <p>Most things have a color, and not everything is the same color. So we can separate objects by color.</p>

            <h3>
              <a id="ok1" class="anchor" href="#ok1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ok.
            </h3>

            <p>So not only do you point at the business or person, you also select its color. For example, <font color="red">Brick Street</font> is red, <font color="orange">Orange Leaf</font> is orange, etc. Again, because they are <b>within visual range</b>, you will know what color they are. Btw for this test there are only like a dozen pingable businesses and they are all on high street.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="so-i-point" class="anchor" href="#so-i-point" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So I point my phone at something and it figures out what color it is and-
            </h3>

            <p>No. There is no magic here. <b>Colors are set manually</b> by the pingable object or person. The camera is not used.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="what-about-people" class="anchor" href="#what-about-people" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What about people?
            </h3>
            <p>I assumed it would be the color of your clothes. But, there are no rules. You can <b>tap and hold on a color to set your own color.</b> 
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="no-creeps" class="anchor" href="#no-creeps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I don't want creeps pointing their phone at me and finding out who I am!!!
            </h3>
            <p>
              Being pingable yourself is <b>totally optional.</b> There is a simple toggle to turn it on or off. I’m also considering an option to only be pingable by certain other people (i.e., only facebook friends, friends of friends, or anyone). 
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="people-can-wear" class="anchor" href="#people-can-wear" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>People can wear clothes with more than one color or a color that is not in your app. Same goes for businesses. What then?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I was thinking the most “dominant” color, or the one that stands out the most, but I don’t know. Again, there are no rules. That's what this test is about and I’d be interested to hear feedback about it. Nothing is set in stone. 
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="scan" class="anchor" href="#scan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why don't you have the app "scan" instead of pinging once; so that as you move your phone different results appear based on what you're pointing at?
            </h3>
            <p>
              This is a possibility. However, the original idea was that <b>you have found what you are looking for</b> and you just want information about it, as opposed to <b>searching nearby things.</b> Also this helps mitigate the creepy issue where people would simply move their phone around looking for anybody in range. Tell me what you think. 
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="friend" class="anchor" href="#friend" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can my friend try it?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes, have them email me. 
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a id="limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Limitations
            </h3>
            <p>
              &#8226 <b>Ping doesn't work well indoors.</b> The limitations of GPS prevent proper indoor functioning. Don’t let that stop you from trying, but don’t expect it to work either. If the pîng logo at the top of the main screen is blurry then that means your location is not well defined and you will have trouble. 
            </p>

            <p>
              &#8226 <b>The compass needs to be calibrated.</b> Pîng relies on the iPhone’s internal magnetometer, and it needs to be calibrated to work right. If you aren’t getting the results you want, imagine there is a ball on the screen of your iPhone. Now turn and twist the iPhone such that the imaginary ball reaches every corner of the screen. Do that a couple times. 
            </p>

            <p>
              &#8226 <b>There are no push notifications.</b> You will not be notified of being pinged or the arrival of new messages; you have to look at the app to check manually. 
            </p>
            <p>Please <a href="mailto:kochrt@miamioh.edu">email me</a> if you find bugs or have suggestions for improvement. If you don't tell me I won't know about it! </p>
