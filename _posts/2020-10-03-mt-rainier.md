##### Naches Peak Loop trail

{:.container}
We went around the east side of Rainier early in the morning (the only real time to go, otherwise you'll be in line waiting to enter the park). On the way is a trailhead off of 410, Naches Peak Loop Trail. It's an easy hike with great views of the surrounding area and Rainier.

##### Stevens Canyon Rd

{:.container}
We went around the east side of Rainier early in the morning (the only real time to go, otherwise you'll be in line waiting to enter the park). It's a fun drive up with great views of the tallest mountain in the state of Washington.

##### Paradise

{:.container}
So I'm looking at these photos I took and they just don't quite work. It's an enormous mountain that you really just need to see in person.

But anyway, Paradise is about as close to the peak as the general public gets, unless you're hiking up or attempting to summit it. Worth going to. It was busy, though, so we didn't stay long.

Down the hill a bit is Longmire, where the national park lodge is. There is a small cafe and a gift shop. Both were fairly busy, even given the COVID situation.
